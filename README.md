# Assignment

# Installation
- `git clone git@github.com:DominikHurtienne/assignment.git`
- `composer install`
- `php artisan serve`
- `php artisan migrate`
- `php artisan db:seed` (adds 10 products)

# What I did
Working prototype, visit `/products`

Initially created products are shown in a simple view, clicking on the add to cart button adds them in the database to the corresponding card tables.


# Out-of-scope due to time constraint
- reduce the number of available products when adding to card
- backend validation when adding to cart.
- checkout, registration, coupon creation and sending
